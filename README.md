# <b>CSCI 6370 : Database Management - Term Project</b>

#

## <b>How To Run and Compile:</b>
#
NOTE:
Project tested on,

  - MacOS 13.3.1
  - JVM 17.0.6
  - Gradle 7.6
  - Groovy 3.0.13
  - Python 3.10.9
  - MySQL 8.0.31

### **Step - 1 : Install Gradle**
- Install Gradle by following the instructions from <a herf = "https://gradle.org/install/">https://gradle.org/install/</a> (Don't Forget to configure your system environment as mentioned in step-3 of this link.)

### **Step - 2 : Go to Installed Project Directory**
- Now, open your terminal or command prompt and go to the project directory.

  - If you have not set the path for MySQL in your command line :
  - For MAC users:

    ```bash
    export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin
    ```

  - For Windows user Click on or Copy this link and paste in your web browser, https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-windows-excerpt/5.7/en/mysql-installation-windows-path.html

### **Step - 3 : Update Environment Variable**
- Update environment variable as per your MySQL credentials. (don't forget to type password of your MySQL root user in <b>`DB_PASS`</b> field because here it is left blank.)

  - Following is for the MAC user.

    ```bash
    export DB_USER=root
    export DB_HOST=localhost
    export DB_PASS=   # Have to write your MySQL root Use Password
    export DB_PORT=3306
    ```

  - For Example,

    ```bash
    export DB_PASS=abc # Don't give space after "="
    ```

  - If You are using Windows or the above thing don't workout for MAC user, you have to type the password of MySQL root user in `DB_PASS` variable in the `DBConnector.java` file (`line number 19`) (`DBConnector.java` file is located in `lib\src\main\ava\project\local`) and also have to write the root user password in `create_database.py` file(`line number 171`)

### **Step-4 : Setup Pro-Kabaddi League (PKL) Database** 
- In this step you will setup the PKL database.
- To set the database you have to just run the `create_database.py` file.
  - `pandas` and `mysql` library of  `Python` should be installed
    ```bash
    pip install pandas mysql
    ```
- On Successful run of the `create_database.py` file you will receive following output.
  ```
  Pro-Kabaddi League Database is created successfullyðŸ¥³!! (Name of Database is pkl)
  ```
### **Step - 5 : Build Project and Run Web Server** 
- To do that use following command in terminal.

  ```bash
  gradle build && gradle appRun
  ```

### **Step - 6 : Start Client**
- Open site in browser : [WEBSITE LINK](http://localhost:8080/dbms/index.jsp) or copy paste - http://localhost:8080/dbms/index.jsp

#

## Additional things:

- In case a JAVA version issues:

  ```bash
  gradle build -Dorg.gradle.java.home=/JDK_PATH
  ```
